LinkUp is an app for creating and joining events based on shared interests. The App will enable people to meet existing friends and make new friends through activities such as sports, games, excursions. Users are able to communicate via a group chat, based on event participants. The mission of the app is to enable people who want to make new friends to do so via their shared interests. Furthermore, established friend groups will have a forum to create and organize their activities.
